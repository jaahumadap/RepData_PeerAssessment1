# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1
This document describes the process and code that was followed to analyze activity data for a personal monitoring activity device. The data comes from [here] (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip) and is two months of activity data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012.

The questions that we are trying to answer here are:

- What is the mean total number of steps taken per day by this individual?
- What is the average daily activity pattern of this individual?
- Are there any differences in the activity pattern between weekdays and weekends?

## Loading and preprocessing the data



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
